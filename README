/*!\mainpage Quantum simulation software.
This program is designed to study the Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) 
which is relevant, for instance, to describe Bose-Einstein Condensates.

\section install Installation
In the source directory of this software simply issue the commands:
\verbatim
$ make all
$ sudo make install
\endverbatim
A working copy of the program should now be installed in the /opt/bin/
directory.

\section usage Usage
In this section we assume that the program is build and installed according
to the procedure described in Section \ref install.

\subsection cmdline Command line invocation
To invoke the program you will need to issue a command of the form:
\verbatim
$ qsimu CONFIG_FILE [OPTIONS] [ACTIONS]
\endverbatim
where:
- \verbatim CONFIG_FILE\endverbatim is a configuration file,
- \verbatim[OPTIONS]\endverbatim is a list of options,
- \verbatim[ACTIONS]\endverbatim is a list of actions.

Please note that only the configuration file is necessary to run the program
otherwise you will get an error, but it will perform something usefull only if
you select an action.
To get more information on the options or actions see:
\verbatim
$ qsimu --usage
\endverbatim

\subsection config Configuration file
The configuration file provides the necessary informations to initialize the 
program using a specific syntax. This file is cut into fields, labelled by a 
keyword between square brackets, which consists in a list of assignment.

The assignments are of the form: keyword=value, where value is either a string,
a constant or a mathematical expression.

The allowed fields are:
- [general] with the assignments:
    - equation=mathematical expression,
    - potential=mathematical expression,
    - dt=constant,
    - tol=constant,
    - dttol=constant,
- [grid] with one of this sets of assignments:
    - For cartesian problems (coordinates X, Y, Z):
        - nx=integer constant,
        - ny=integer constant,
        - nz=integer constant,
        - Lx=constant,
        - Ly=constant,
        - Lz=constant,
    - For polar coordinates problems (coordinate R):
        - nr=integer constant,
        - rmin=constant,
        - rmax=constant.
- [parameters] (optional) contains all the user defined literal constants used
in the "equation" or "potential" assignments.

\subsection tutorial Tutorials
This section explains how to use the program to study some typical equations.

\subsubsection harmonic One dimensionnal harmonic oscillator
Lets assume we want to study a single particle, described by its wavefunction
\f$\left|\psi(t,x)\right>\f$, trapped in a harmonic potential and evolving
according to the Schrodinger equation:
\f[
\imath\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left|\psi(t,x)\right>
=\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
+\frac{1}{2}m\omega_x^2x^2\right)\left|\psi(t,x)\right>.
\f]
For the sake of simplicity we will work with dimensionless units (note
that it is only for convinience and not a constraint of the program) let us 
define:
\f[
X=\frac{x}{a_x},~T=\omega_xt,~\textrm{and}~
\left|\Psi(T,X)\right>=\sqrt{a_x}\left|\psi(t,x)\right>,
\f]
where \f$a_x=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega_x}}\f$ is the caracteristic length of
the harmonic oscillator.
One can thus write the Schrodinger equation in the form:
\f[
\imath\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left|\Psi(T,X)\right>
=\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial X^2}
+\frac{1}{2}X^2\right)\left|\Psi(T,X)\right>.
\f]
Let say we want to find the ground state of this system, find the time evolution
of an initial wavefunction or compute find the excited states of the system.
Now how to address these problems with the program ?

First, we need to define the problem, so we create (or modify) a configuration
file so that it contains:
\verbatim
[general]
equation=-1/2*DELTA+VEXT
potential=1/2*X^2
\endverbatim
What does that mean ? Let us see, line by line:
- \verbatim [general]\endverbatim is a label to tell the program that this part will
define the problem,
- \verbatim equation=-1/2*DELTA+VEXT\endverbatim is the right hand side of the
dimensionless Schrodinger equation written above,
- \verbatim potential=1/2*X^2\endverbatim defines the potential (in the correct
units).

Why is it written this way ? Mainly for technical issues: we want to split the
right hand side of the Schrodinger equation into two parts: the first for the
kinetic energy and the second for the potential energy. This will prove usefull
when using the split operator method to compute the system evolution. Note that
VEXT is defined in the last line as the harmonic potential and that DELTA is
implictly defined as the Laplacian.

The next thing to do is to define the spatial grid on which we discretize the
wavefunction. This is done by modifying the configuration file:
\verbatim
[general]
equation=-1/2*DELTA+VEXT
potential=1/2*X^2
[grid]
nx=128
Lx=16
\endverbatim
We now see a new label that informs the program that the next section will be
used to define the grid, in a straigthforward way, by giving the number of
points and the size of the box.
Note that the grid is symmetric about the point X=0 and that the size Lx
is expressed in the length unit used in the Schrodinger equation.

Now how to choose the size of the box or the number of grid points ? This is a
good question that needs to be treated carefully. In the real space we need
enough points to accuratly describe the wavefunction:
\f[
\frac{L_x}{n_x}\ll\Delta X\ll\frac{L_x}{2},
\f]
where \f$\Delta X\f$ is the rms width of the wavefunction probability 
distribution. Reciprocally, in the Fourier space we have:
\f[
\frac{1}{L_x}\ll\Delta K\ll\frac{n_x}{2L_x}.
\f]

A good appoach is then to consider that we need to take into account the 
Heisenberg uncertainty principle:
\f[
\Delta X \Delta K\geq\frac{1}{2}.
\f]

Finally let us point out that it is preferable (for numerical reasons) to use a
number of grid points that can be expressed as some power of 2.

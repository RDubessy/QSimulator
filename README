/*!\mainpage Quantum simulation software.
This program is designed to study the Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) 
which is relevant, for instance, to describe Bose-Einstein Condensates.

\section install Installation
In the source directory of this software simply issue the commands:
\verbatim
$ make all
$ sudo make install
\endverbatim
A working copy of the program should now be installed in the /opt/bin/
directory.

\section usage Usage
In this section we assume that the program is build and installed according
to the procedure described in Section \ref install.

\subsection cmdline Command line invocation
To invoke the program you will need to issue a command of the form:
\verbatim
$ qsimu CONFIG_FILE [OPTIONS] [ACTIONS]
\endverbatim
where:
- \verbatim CONFIG_FILE\endverbatim is a configuration file,
- \verbatim[OPTIONS]\endverbatim is a list of options,
- \verbatim[ACTIONS]\endverbatim is a list of actions.

Please note that only the configuration file is necessary to run the program
otherwise you will get an error, but it will perform something usefull only if
you select an action.
These three elements are described more completely hereafter.

\subsubsection config Configuration file
The configuration file provides the necessary informations to initialize the 
program using a specific syntax. This file is cut into fields, labelled by a 
keyword between square brackets, which consists in a list of assignment.
You may want to have a look at an \ref examplefile.

The assignments are of the form: keyword=value, where value is either a string,
a constant or a mathematical expression.

The allowed fields are:
- [general] with the assignments:
    - equation=mathematical expression,
    - potential=mathematical expression,
    - type=string,
    - dt=constant,
    - tol=constant,
    - dttol=constant,
- [problem] where [problem] is one of these:
    - [x1D] sets up a GPE1D problem,
    - [x2D] sets up a GPE2D problem,
    - [x3D] sets up a GPE3D problem,
    - [polar] sets up a Polar1D problem,
- [parameters] (optional) contains all the user defined literal constants used
in the "equation" or "potential" assignments.

\subsubsection actions Actions
The actions are passed to the program as
\subsubsection options Options
\subsection example Examples
\subsubsection examplefile Example configuration file
The following configuration file will set up a GPE1D problem on a 256 points grid
with harmonic trapping potential and interactions.
\verbatim
[general]
equation=(-1/2)*DELTA+VEXT+g*RHO
potential=1/2*X^2
type=Cartesian1D
dt=1e-3
tol=1e-12
dttol=0.9
[parameters]
g=8000
[x1D]
n=256
L=16
\endverbatim

\subsubsection groundstate Computing the ground state
\verbatim $ qsimu example.cfg --groundstate --log=log.txt --out=psi0.dat\endverbatim
\subsubsection spectrum Computing the spectrum
\verbatim $ qsimu example.cfg --log=log.txt --in=psi0.dat --spectrum\endverbatim
